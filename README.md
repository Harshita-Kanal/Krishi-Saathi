A Companion for Farmers <br>
India is an agricultural land, a large proportion of Indiaâ€™s population depends on agriculture as a means of livelihood, hence, It is a need to empower the farmer with technology.
To adopt better practices and help the farmer adopt smart practices, also ensure that the farmer gets the best price for his product and the profits are not lost to the middleman, an effort should be made to connect the citizen directly with the farmer and harness the power of ai to detect crop diseases to ensure that all necessary precautions are taken to protect crops and avoid wastage of produce.
